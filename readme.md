## Cogito ergo sum
- Rene Descartes

René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now Descartes, Indre-et-Loire), France, on 31 March 1596.[21] His mother, Jeanne Brochard, died soon after giving birth to him, and so he was not expected to survive.[21] Descartes' father, Joachim, was a member of the Parlement of Brittany at Rennes.[22] René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots.[23] In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Flèche,[24][25] where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work.[24][26] After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615–16) at the University of Poitiers, earning a Baccalauréat and Licence in canon and civil law in 1616,[24] in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer.[27] From there he moved to Paris.
